## Process Management Simulation
    
- this is a simulation of how OS handle process scheduling
- uses both preemptive and non-preemptive algorithms

### About the Project

This project was originally a part of a school requirement,
but I further improved it by adding more scheduling algorithms and a frontend website.
The original codes are still kept inside the *OriginalCodes* folder.

Puropse of making it a webpage is to learn/practice javascript, html, and css.
