## Process Management Simulation
    
- this is a simulation of how OS handle process scheduling
- uses both preemptive and non-preemptive algorithms

### About the Project

This project was originally a part of a school requirement,
but I (will) further improved it by adding more scheduling algorithms and a frontend website.

The original codes are still kept inside the *OriginalCodes* folder.

[ Unfinished, will work on it soon ]
