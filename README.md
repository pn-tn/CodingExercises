## Coding Exercises Repository

This repository serves as a collection of small coding projects I've completed during my studies.
Each project focuses on different concepts, algorithms, or technologies I've learned along the way.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder representing an individual project.
Inside each project folder, you'll find the relevant source code files, documentation, and any additional assets specific to that project.

### Project List

Here's an overview of the projects included in this repository:

- [EvolutionSimulation]: A simple simulation about natural selection.
- [LSTM_Project]: Project that attempts to predict future cases of covid using LSTM.
- [shootingGame]: 2d shooting game made in python.
- [Process Management Simulation]: Simulation of how OS handle process scheduling.
