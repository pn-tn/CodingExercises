## Coding Exercises Repository

Welcome to my Coding Exercises Repository! This repository serves as a collection of small coding projects I've completed during my studies.
Each project focuses on different concepts, algorithms, or technologies I've learned along the way.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder representing an individual project.
Inside each project folder, you'll find the relevant source code files, documentation, and any additional assets specific to that project.

### Project List

Here's an overview of the projects included in this repository:

- [EvolutionSimulation]: A simple simulation about natural selection.
- [LSTM_Project]: Project that attempts to predict future cases of covid using LSTM.
- [shootingGame]: 2d shooting game made in python.

- [Project n]: Brief description of Project n.

### :D

I welcome suggestions, or feedback on any of the projects.
If you have ideas for improvement or spot any issues, feel free to let me know.

Thank you for visiting my Coding Exercises Repository!
I hope these projects serve as examples of my coding skills and demonstrate my growth as a developer during my studies.
