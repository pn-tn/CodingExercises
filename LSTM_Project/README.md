## Covid Prediction with Machine Learning

LSTM model to predict future data based on existing ones.
in this project, I attempted to use existing data to predict future covid cases in the Philippines

Upon the creation of this project, I learned that LSTM models are not really good at extrapolating.
Still, it is a model that can give an educated guess based on existing data.

### Running the Project

This project was created using jupyter lab.
To run this project you can upload the code in this site: https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/
